üìú Contract Description
-----------------------

The **AutoResolve** smart contract is a cutting-edge, decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that pioneers **automated dispute resolution** using **predictive analytics**. This contract provides a trustless, transparent, and efficient mechanism for settling disagreements between parties without the need for traditional, slow, and expensive legal processes.

At its core, AutoResolve leverages a sophisticated machine learning-style model to analyze submitted evidence and predict the likely outcome of a dispute. This prediction is then used to automatically and impartially release escrowed funds, ensuring a fair and data-driven resolution. The system includes robust features for:

-   **Escrow Management**: Securely holds funds for the duration of the dispute, ensuring they are only released based on the contract's logic.

-   **Evidence Submission**: Allows both the plaintiff and defendant to submit evidence, each with an assigned `weight` to indicate its importance.

-   **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes a multi-factor analysis (simulated with a complex algorithm) that considers evidence quality, case complexity, temporal factors, and even historical success patterns to generate a probabilistic outcome and a confidence score.

-   **Decentralized Arbitrators**: A registry for approved arbitrators who are authorized to trigger the dispute resolution process.

-   **Appeal Mechanism**: An automatic deadline for appeals is set upon resolution, though the appeal functionality itself is left to a future implementation.

This contract represents a significant step forward in on-chain governance and dispute resolution, offering a scalable and impartial solution for a wide range of use cases, from e-commerce transactions to service agreements.

üíª Functions
------------

### **Public Functions**

-   `create-dispute(defendant: principal, amount: uint)`: Initiates a new dispute. The transaction sender is registered as the plaintiff, and the specified `amount` of STX is transferred into a secure escrow. Returns the `dispute-id` upon success.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `defendant`: The principal of the party against whom the dispute is being filed.

        -   `amount`: The amount of STX to be held in escrow.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok uint)` with the new dispute ID, or an error.

-   `submit-evidence(dispute-id: uint, evidence-hash: (buff 32), weight: uint)`: Allows either the plaintiff or the defendant to submit evidence. Each piece of evidence is identified by a unique `evidence-hash` and is assigned a `weight` (1-10) reflecting its perceived importance. This function can only be called when the dispute is in the `evidence` state.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `dispute-id`: The ID of the dispute.

        -   `evidence-hash`: A cryptographic hash of the evidence data.

        -   `weight`: The importance weight of the evidence (1-10).

    -   **Returns**: `(ok uint)` with the evidence ID, or an error.

-   `open-evidence-phase(dispute-id: uint)`: Transitions an `open` dispute to the `evidence` state, allowing parties to submit evidence. This function can only be called by the plaintiff or defendant.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `dispute-id`: The ID of the dispute.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok bool)` with `true` on success, or an error.

-   `resolve-dispute(dispute-id: uint)`: Triggers the predictive analytics engine to resolve the dispute. This function can only be called by a registered arbitrator. It calculates a winner based on the submitted evidence and releases the escrowed funds to that party.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `dispute-id`: The ID of the dispute.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok {winner: principal, confidence: uint})` with the winning party's principal and the prediction's confidence score, or an error.

-   `register-arbitrator(arbitrator: principal)`: Allows the contract owner to add a new principal to the list of authorized arbitrators.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `arbitrator`: The principal to be registered.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok bool)` with `true` on success, or an error.

-   `advanced-dispute-prediction(dispute-id: uint)`: A view function that provides a comprehensive, multi-factor analysis of a dispute. It simulates an advanced machine learning model to generate a detailed prediction report without altering the contract's state.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `dispute-id`: The ID of the dispute.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok { ... })` with a detailed prediction report, or an error.

### **Private Functions**

-   `calculate-prediction(dispute-id: uint)`: An internal helper function used to calculate a basic prediction score based on submitted evidence.

-   `calculate-evidence-score(dispute-id: uint, party: principal)`: An internal helper function that sums the weights of evidence submitted by a specific party.

-   `get-evidence-weight(evidence-data: {dispute-id: uint, evidence-id: uint})`: An internal helper function to retrieve the weight of a specific piece of evidence.

-   `enumerate-evidence(dispute-id: uint, party: principal)`: An internal helper function that simulates enumerating evidence for a party (currently simplified).

-   `release-escrow(dispute-id: uint, winner: principal)`: An internal helper function that transfers escrowed funds to the designated winner.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Structures
-------------------

### **Maps**

-   `disputes`: Stores the core details of each dispute, including the parties, amount, state, and resolution metadata.

-   `evidence`: Maps a composite key (`dispute-id`, `evidence-id`) to the details of each submitted evidence, such as the `submitter` and `evidence-hash`.

-   `evidence-counters`: Tracks the number of evidence submissions for each dispute.

-   `escrow`: Holds the amount of STX locked for each active dispute.

-   `model-weights`: A map for future use to store and adjust weights for the predictive model.

-   `arbitrators`: A registry of authorized arbitrators.

### **Variables**

-   `dispute-counter`: A global counter that increments with each new dispute, providing a unique ID.

üõ°Ô∏è Error Codes
---------------

The contract utilizes a clear and concise set of error codes to communicate the cause of a failed transaction:

-   `u100`: `err-owner-only` - The function can only be called by the contract owner.

-   `u101`: `err-not-found` - The specified dispute ID or evidence could not be found.

-   `u102`: `err-unauthorized` - The transaction sender is not authorized to perform this action.

-   `u103`: `err-invalid-state` - The dispute is not in the correct state for the requested action.

-   `u104`: `err-insufficient-funds` - The sender does not have enough STX to create a dispute.

-   `u105`: `err-invalid-evidence` - The submitted evidence `weight` is outside the allowed range (1-10).
